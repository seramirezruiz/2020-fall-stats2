      <description>Measuring the effect of information on peace agreement support 
The country of Absurdistan has had an ongoing civil conflict for the past 60 years. The fighting between national government forces and guerrilla members from the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) has lead to more than 200,000 deaths, 8 million internally displaced persons, and countless victims between 1960 to 2020. The civil war in Absurdistan has been a low-intensity asymmetric war.</description>

      <description>Measuring the effect of a soda tax on sugar-added drink consumption After the very succesful impact evaluations you have performed in the past weeks, you are contacted by the local government of Pawnee, Indiana. The city is interested in your advice to assess a policy intervention passed with the support of councilwoman Leslie Knope.
The city of Pawnee has been at the spotlight recently, as it has come to be known as the child obesity and diabetes capital of the state of Indiana.</description>

      <description>Welcome Today we will have a look at instrumental variables. We will explore encouragement experimental designs and how IVs can be used in observational data settings. Additionally, we will learn how to calculate our LATE manually with the wald estimator and in R with two-stage square least regressions through ivreg

      <description>Welcome In this week&#39;s lecture reviewed bivariate and multiple linear regressions. You also learned how they relate to the Potential Outcomes Framework and can be used, under certain conditions, for causal inference.
In this lab session we will:
 Take a step back to review how to create tables and perform t-tests in R Learn to run regression models using R Learn how to present to your results in neat tables  We will use a package called wooldridge that contains dozens of datasets used by Jeffrey M.</description>

      <description>Welcome! The practical component of the Statistics II: Statistical Modeling and Causal Inference course relies largely in R programming. Today we will center on some of the necessary skills to perform the assignments for the course. Finally, we will dive into some of the substance of the class by exploring the Potential Outcomes Framework.
In this tutorial, you will learn to:
 identify the some of the basic functionalities of R and RStudio import data sets into your R environment distinguish the foundations of the Potential Outcomes Framework (POF) apply dplyr verbs to retrieve estimates   R and RStudio: Basics The RStudio layout RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R.</description>
